<h1>Excluding of a subscribers from list using CSV file - Help page</h1>
<br/><br/>
<p> Allows you to exclude all subscribers that present in CSV from current list. 
Component uses subscriber's email for matching.

<p>If you get success(green) message after upload but still cant see the content of
a first row (or see not all fields) in <b>"Fields identified in the imported file"</b> fieldset
then probably you need to play with <b>Settings</b> setting the proper delimiter and enclosure.

<p>Also here you can specify if your file contain usefull data in the first row 
or it just header with column names. Use <b>"Skip the header"</b> setting to do it.
