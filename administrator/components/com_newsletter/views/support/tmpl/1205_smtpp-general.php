<p>Sometimes those who manage a newsletter might use more than one Internet service provider. 
Component has SMTP profiles that allows you to manage your newsletters more flexible. 
SMTP profile is a bunch of settings to connect to SMTP server and additional parameters used in component. 
When you select some SMTP profile in newsletter (or list) you order that this 
SMTP connection will be used to send this newsletter. 
To add, edit or assign profile as default go to Configuration -> General -> Default SMPT profile.

<p>SMTP profile has these options:
<ul>
	<li>Name - is the verbal name of a profile</li>
	<li>From name - name used as FROM NAME.</li>
	<li>From email - email used as FROM EMAIL. Note that for most servers it should be identical to email of your SMTP server account.</li>
	<li>Reply to name - name used as REPLY TO NAME</li>
	<li>Reply to email - email used as REPLY TO EMAIL. Note that for most servers it should be identical to email of your SMTP server account.</li>

<p>Some of SMTP servers have the limitation of amount of sent mails per time interval. 
The  “Count of mails will be sent in each mailing period” and “Length of mailing period (in minutes)” 
options are intended to tune up a SMTP profile to fit into these restrictions.
